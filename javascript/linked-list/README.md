# Linked List

## What is a Linked List

- A linked list is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a linked list is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

### There are two types of linked list Stringly and Doubly.

-  A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

-  Head in the Linked List represents the starting Node
- Nodes have two things a Value, which is the data and Next, which references another node.

- Next can be NULL or another node.

-  Singly Linked List goes in one direction.

- Doubly Linked List is a reference to both the next and previous Node.

- Current is a reference type to the Node currently being looked at.

### Transversal means walking around
